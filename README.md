**NotChess**
 is a multiplayer web application in which you can play *AntiChess*, a variant of the well known Chess game in which the goal is to be the first to **lose** all of your pieces.
If you wish to join NotChess' community and play some games of AntiChess, you can do so by following these steps:
* Download Node.js on your machine -> You can find a extensive guide [here](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/getting-started-with-nodejs "Node js installation guide").
* Open your terminal and execute the following commands:
    * git clone https://github.com/sbencoding/NotChess.git
    * cd notchess
    * npm install
    * npm start</ul></ul>
You should be capable now of accesing the game [here](http://localhost:3000/ "the local host") now.
