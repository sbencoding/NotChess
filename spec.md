# Game Assignment

**Chosen game**: Antichess

Some online examples:
* greenchess.net/rules.php?v=suicide
    - It doesn't have a clear button to play the game, neither a tutorial, only an explanation of the rules.
    - The user needs to think about how to start the game, it's not very clear at first sight
    - Not self-evident nor self-explanatory, it's hard to identify how to start a game
    - Aesthetics: The UI looks old, the text color and the background color is not the best choice, it's a bit hard to read
* arcadespot.com/game/anti-chess
    - A bit long loading time, but the user interface is very intuitive, however it is not clear what pieces correspond to which figures
    - Not cluttered, it's just the main menu then the board
    - Self-evident: the menu is very simple
    - Aesthetics: Looks nice, maybe a bit too styled to be clear
* lichess.org (some setup required)
    - Starting a a game with this variant was pretty easy, however the site offers much more functionality then just playing this one variant of chess
    - Because this is a general chess site, it is a bit cluttered compared to our other examples
    - Self-explanatory, because although there are a lot of options, all of them are explained
    - Aesthetics: Looks clean, the UI is modern

**Encountered positive features:**
* the second website has a nice UI for the case when the only possible move(s) is to take the opponents piece
* with the third website the game was easy to share, since it had a unique link
* with the first and third website the standard appearance of the pieces were nice

**Encountered negative features:**
* the second site automatically started playing audio, not very nice
* The color scheme of the menu for the first site makes the site a bit hard to read
* the third site contained too many options (although it's acceptable for them since they're a general chess site)
