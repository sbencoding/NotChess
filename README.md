**NotChess**
 is a multiplayer web application in which you can play *AntiChess*, a variant of the well known Chess game in which the goal is to be the first to **lose** all of your pieces.
If you wish to join NotChess' community and play some games of AntiChess, you can following commands:
* git clone https://github.com/sbencoding/NotChess.git
* cd NotChess
* npm install
* npm start</ul>
You should be capable now of accesing the game [here](http://localhost:3000/ "the local host") now.
If you would like to support NotChess, you can do so [here](http://NotChess/millionares)! (We thank you a lot if you decide to support us!).
